/**
@mainpage Opticks Python Integration

\section overview Overview
The Python Interface to Opticks provides access to Opticks data and functionality through a defined set of Python commands.
This interface supports interaction with data loaded in Opticks through both interactive Python and Python scripts.
The interface is accessed through the scripting window in Opticks, which accepts Python commands and displays Python output in the interactive interpreter.
The Python Interface also supports batch processing through the Opticks Wizard functionality.
This capability allows users to run Opticks plug-ins from Python and run Python scripts from Opticks.
Python commands can be run from a wizard by adding the <tt>Python Interpreter</tt> desktop wizard item to a wizard and passing the Python code as a string.

The Python Interface is designed to provide a mechanism for rapidly prototyping new algorithms in Python while leveraging Opticks functionality.
Introductory material on Python use is beyond the scope of this document which assumes at least a basic familiarity with the Python language.
